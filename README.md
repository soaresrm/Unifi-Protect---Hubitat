# Unifi-Protect---Hubitat
App and Driver for Unifi Protect - Hubitat

Since moving from ST to HE the thing I missed the most was the Unifi Protect Integration done by:

https://github.com/project802/smartthings/

So i tried to Port it to HE... So far the App is working it can detect and add the cameras as devices.
But that's pretty much it....

The Driver Code is still work in Progress
